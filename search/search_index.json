The Blockchain OS offers a Linux operating system coupled with a blockchain infrastructure, which allows DApps to be developed in familiar programming languages like Python without the need to write Solidity code. As a developer, you can use all the programming languages, tools, libraries, software, and services you know. However, developers are freed from the limitations and quirks imposed by blockchains by moving most of the complex logic of their DApps to portable off-chain components. In this way, Cartesi empowers developers to select the best run-time environment to host each part of their DApps.
